## Youtube channel recommendations

### Video essays and general reflections over our current state as society

- `[active]` `[en]` [pagemelt](https://www.youtube.com/@pagemelt/videos): They are migrating over from short videos to longer ones so it only has 3 videos at time of writing, the style of the videos are more analytical, but it also offers positivity and actual solutions to the problems presented.
- `[active]` `[en]` [struthless](https://www.youtube.com/@struthless/videos): Their videos are really fun and nostalgic to watch, it offers a more positive approach to our current shitty societal situation.

### Video essays about technology

- `[active]` `[en]` [InternetOfBugs](https://www.youtube.com/@InternetOfBugs/videos): Most of my AI news comes from this channel, his content does a great job at unraveling the sensacionalism around AI.

### Video essays about general media (movies, animes, series, etc.)

- `[active]` `[pt-br]` [infernodedante](https://www.youtube.com/@infernodedante/videos): This channel has videos about mostly anime and it's essays from a more philosophical way looking into characters, moments and groups of the particular anime. The analysis are really great and the video vibe is calmying.

### General story telling videos

- `[active]` `[en]` [jaidenanimations](https://www.youtube.com/@jaidenanimations/videos): I love their style of telling stories and the cool animations are cool (y).

### Live coding stream vods (lengthy videos)

- `[active]` `[en]` [HirschDaniel](https://www.youtube.com/@HirschDaniel/videos): Mostly video about low level coding as well, with C and Bash.
- `[active]` `[en]` [TsodingDaily](https://www.youtube.com/@TsodingDaily/videos): Mostly video of C, but tsoding does a bit of everything in what he calls "recreational programming sessions", overall really cool live coding vods.
- `[active]` `[en]` [janetacarr](https://www.youtube.com/@janetacarr/videos): This channel is mostly for live stream vods upload and it's quite nice for me that can't stick around live, her vods are mostly about clojure and clojurescript coding and I watch for the cool emacs setup as well.
- `[active]` `[pt-br]` [leandronsp](https://www.youtube.com/@leandronsp/videos): His videos are in portuguese and cover projects using pure bash, pure assembly and rust. The content is amazing both for the computer science pure content and for the entertainment of watching live coding.
- `[inactive]` `[en]` [MichaelStapelberg](https://www.youtube.com/@MichaelStapelberg/videos): Unfortunately the channel is inactive, but I like the emacs setup and the development live coding. Michael is the creator of i3wm and gokrazy, so it's nice to watch a seasoned open source developer code.

### Linux/Unix and Free software content

- `[active]` `[en]` [BreadOnPenguins](https://www.youtube.com/@BreadOnPenguins/videos): Mostly videos about quick recommendations for WM and CLI programs focused on unix/linux environments, recently they also uploaded some videos of live stream studying and general essays about life, I really like the cozy style of the channel.

### Music

- `[active]` `[en]` [Yellow Cherry Jam](https://www.youtube.com/@yellowcherry_jam/videos): I love listening to lo-fi while studying, working or doing chores because it energizes me overall and allow me to focus easily, but nowadays the mainstream lo-fi radios are just AI slop. This band is human in every sense and i'm here for it.

## Blog recommendations

### Music

- `[active]` `[en]` [Bandcamp](https://daily.bandcamp.com/): I'm redescovering my love for music with their articles, simply top notch music journalism.

### Programming

- `[active]` `[en]` [Cassidoo](https://cassidoo.co/blog/): Her blog is a gem overall, both from the technical perspective of listening to such a seasoned programmer, but also her personal blogposts are really inspiring.
