&lt;p>This post is a continuation to the original implementation, you can read at: &lt;a href="https://cherryramatis.xyz/posts/native-fuzzy-finder-in-neovim-with-lua-and-cool-bindings/">https://cherryramatis.xyz/posts/native-fuzzy-finder-in-neovim-with-lua-and-cool-bindings/&lt;/a>&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>After using the native fuzzy finder implementation everyday for almost a month now I can safely say it&amp;rsquo;s quite great for my personal workflow, it works flawlessly and it&amp;rsquo;s simple enough so I can extend easily. One thing though that is a bit annoying is how often the popup window updates (it updates each time you press a character), sometimes that much update add some flickering to the popup re-rendering. Luckily &lt;a href="mailto:martini97@protonmail.ch">Alessandro&lt;/a> contacted me with a better implementation that not only simplified a bit the code, but also added a debounce function to avoid that much update cycles.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Quick Tip for the Week #1: Making Netrw More Usable</title><link>/posts/quick-tip-for-the-week-1-making-netrw-more-usable/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Aug 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/quick-tip-for-the-week-1-making-netrw-more-usable/</guid><description>&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s definitely not new to any Neovim user that we have &lt;strong>a lot&lt;/strong> of file browser plugins, all over from the super minimalistic, like &lt;a href="https://github.com/justinmk/vim-dirvish">vim-dirvish,&lt;/a> to the full-blown new experiences like &lt;a href="https://github.com/stevearc/oil.nvim">oil.nvim&lt;/a> or &lt;a href="https://github.com/nvim-neo-tree/neo-tree.nvim">neo-tree.nvim&lt;/a>. But what about netrw? You know, that file browser that comes default with (Neo)Vim and certainly has some weird behaviors? Recently I started thinking about what could be done to fix some of those weird behaviors and potentially remove yet another plugin in my crusade for minimalism. As always, I hope you find something useful for your own config. :)&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Native Fuzzy Finder in Neovim With Lua and Cool Bindings</title><link>/posts/native-fuzzy-finder-in-neovim-with-lua-and-cool-bindings/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Aug 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/native-fuzzy-finder-in-neovim-with-lua-and-cool-bindings/</guid><description>&lt;p>Recently, I read a particular &lt;a href="https://yobibyte.github.io/vim.html">blog post by yobibyte&lt;/a> about a no-plugins approach to Neovim configuration, which stuck with me. I started to think more and more about how much stuff I really need for my config to suit my needs. Personally, the main reason why I resonate so much with a particular family of editors (Vim, Nvim, Kakoune, Emacs, etc.) is the ability to add as much stuff as you want, but at the same time the opportunity to remove as much bloat as possible—a little controversial, but if you think about it, it&amp;rsquo;s the best scenario for customizability. I remember watching a video about the concept of a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMVIJhC9Veg">PDE&lt;/a> coined by a Neovim contributor called teej_dv, and it really stuck with me. These types of editors are more like an environment than just a product with a single goal.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title> (format t "Hello world~%")</title><link>/posts/hello-world/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/hello-world/</guid><description>&lt;p>Nice that you&amp;rsquo;re here!
