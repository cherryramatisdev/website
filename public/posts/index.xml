      <description>&lt;p&gt;Since I read a particular &lt;a href=&#34;https://yobibyte.github.io/vim.html&#34;&gt;blog post by yobibyte&lt;/a&gt; about a minimalist approach to neovim configuration I started to think more about how much stuff do I really need for my config to work properly, particularly the main reason why I resonate so much with a particular family of editors (vim, nvim, kakoune, emacs, etc) is the ability to remove as much bloat as you want, keeping only the powerful features that make sense &lt;strong&gt;to you&lt;/strong&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s totally fine to use a neovim distro on the beginning of your journey, but give a chance to start piece by piece, you&amp;rsquo;ll be amazed by how few things you actually need to write and code at your best (If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in this discussion I highly recommend taking a look at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMVIJhC9Veg&#34;&gt;PDE concept coined by teej_dv&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Nice that you&amp;rsquo;re here! I&amp;rsquo;ll be trying to post both &lt;code&gt;personal&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;tech&lt;/code&gt; related stuff, the idea is to keep me writing more constantly.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
