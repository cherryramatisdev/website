</span><img src=//localhost:1313/rosalia-lux-album-cover.jpeg class=post-cover alt="Trying to Review the Lux Music Album by Rosalia" title="Cover Image"><div class=post-content><div><blockquote><p>Disclaimer: If you found this post randomly, this isn&rsquo;t an analysis nor a review coming from a music expert, it&rsquo;s just my opinions as someone that like different genres and is trying to write more to practice English (and leave doomscrolling). Enjoy and feel free to reach me out if you want :D</p></blockquote><h2 id=my-thoughts-on-the-whole-album>My thoughts on the whole album<a href=#my-thoughts-on-the-whole-album class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>#</a></h2><p>I&rsquo;ve been reading this album for about 2 weeks now, and it&rsquo;s honestly a blast. Each track is so intimate yet powerful and does a great job at guiding you through this ode to the physical and metaphysical world. This album made me cry so much over the weeks, especially on the more dense tracks like <code>Mio cristo piange diamante</code>, <code>Memória</code> and <code>Berghain</code> which for me personally have both a nihilist point of view and also a hopeful one for this relationship with the divine and our world.</p><p>Outside the lyrics and overall sentiment of it, Rosalía also shows her absolute dominance over music theory with the experimentation of different genres over the tracks (which is quite new for me, as I&rsquo;m discovering her now). We go through <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flamenco>flamenco</a>, to <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_music>electronics</a>, to <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_music>classical orchestras</a>, to <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip-hop>hip hop</a>, and even to <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fado>fado</a>.</p><p>The whole album reflects on the human relation with the divine in a raw form, showing its flaws and beautiful parts. This point of view is quite interesting to show us both the optimistic and abusive sides of our own relationship with our deities, and although her point of view comes from a Catholic <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egregore>egregore</a>, it works well to analyze this relation from other egregores as well.</p><h2 id=maybe-god-is-not-a-good-guy-or-maybe-we-are>Maybe God is not a good guy, or maybe we are?<a href=#maybe-god-is-not-a-good-guy-or-maybe-we-are class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>#</a></h2><p>Both in <code>Dios es un stalker</code> and <code>La porcelana</code> we see a negative point of view on two prominent characters on this album: us, the humans, and the deity in question. For example, in <code>Dios es un stalker</code> the deity is portrayed as an obsessive, controlling person that is proud of having this total power over our lives. On the other hand, <code>La porcelana</code> describes the human as the obsessive one that sacrifices itself towards becoming something more; the track references the story of <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ry%C5%8Dnen_Gens%C5%8D>Ryōnen Gensō</a>, a Japanese nun and poet that scarred her own face in order to be accepted in a monastery. In the track, we see the desire to become something that inspires and the acknowledgement that this brings both pain and pleasure; it&rsquo;s a beautiful way to show our obsessive behavior towards the connection with the divine.</p><p>Maybe we both suck? Maybe we, as the creation of the deity, are just as obsessive and controlling as the creator? These tracks really stick with me for providing these opposite thoughts in my mind.</p><h2 id=the-human-side-of-the-divine-itself>The human side of the divine itself<a href=#the-human-side-of-the-divine-itself class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>#</a></h2><p>Probably my favorite track of the whole album, in <code>Mio cristo piange diamanti</code> we get to see this view of Christ as the victim of our own worship towards him; we&rsquo;re presented with a deity that can shatter the whole world with its presence, and it still can fail at doing so. In the chorus, the presence of crying diamonds might refer to our expectation when worshiping these deities, that our worship has become something to achieve a goal instead of the worship being the goal itself.</p><p>On the structure of the track itself, it&rsquo;s the most fragile one by Rosalía in this album; her voice is absolutely divine—matching with the theme, I guess—and broken at the same time. For me, her voice represents the weakness and strength of Christ itself. This view of human fragility being confronted with divine perfectness isn&rsquo;t new; we get to see the same in the story of <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labours_of_Hercules>Hercules&rsquo; labors</a>, where a human works to &ldquo;deserve&rdquo; its own divinity while accepting the fragile nature of his own humanity.</p><h2 id=dealing-with-the-constant-presence-of-death>Dealing with the Constant Presence of Death<a href=#dealing-with-the-constant-presence-of-death class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>#</a></h2><p>Ok, this might be <em>the</em> favorite track of the album; it&rsquo;s megalomaniac and claustrophobic at the same time. For me, it represents the constant presence of death in our lives and how it can cause anxiety day to day. The presence of the orchestra constantly accompanying Rosalía through her day gives us that feeling that something is going to happen all the time, which is really suffocating and constantly puts the main character in an ill state.</p><p>The character of <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bj%C3%B6rk>Björk</a> being represented as a bird is done beautifully; it works as the desire to ascend past the lively world that&rsquo;s been smashing us through this whole song, and it calls for divine intervention as our way out of this situation (the theme of this whole album).</p><p>After that call for the divine, we get the line that breaks the whole song and almost feels out of place, where death itself tries to force us to accept it (this dichotomy of divine being good and abusive is constantly brought up by the album) by shouting out, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll f** you till you love me&rdquo;. The more I think about that line, the more it fits in the track, even though it breaks the whole vibe of the orchestra; <em>that&rsquo;s the purpose of it</em>, to bring you forcefully back to earth to deal with this dark version of death.</p><h2 id=a-farewell-to-the-materialistic-world>A farewell to the materialistic world<a href=#a-farewell-to-the-materialistic-world class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>#</a></h2><p>Almost at the end of the album, we get this <strong>beautiful</strong> track, <code>Memória</code> that brought me to tears multiple times—as it holds a dear place in my heart being a native Portuguese speaker—it represents the end of this journey towards the divine where we, like Hercules, ascended towards the deity but also accepted the faulty nature of our own humanity, wishing that someone is missing and remembering us.</p><p>In the structure of the music, we get an astonishing <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fado>fado</a> sung mainly by <a href=https://genius.com/artists/Carminho>Carminho</a>, which itself is a genre that talks frequently about hope and the feeling of missing someone (which in Portuguese has its own word: &ldquo;saudade&rdquo;).</p><p>The theme covered on this track is super simple, yet it carries that heavy meaning of the whole album up until this point on its shoulders. We (the listeners) got beaten, inspired, and cursed to reach this point as almost a breath of fresh air; all the emotions built through the other tracks reach a climax on this calm and melancholic song.</p><blockquote><p>Even though I like the finish song &ldquo;Magnolias&rdquo;, I wish this song would be the last one, it finishes the whole experience <em>so well</em>, the first time I was listening to the album I almost paused the player after listening to &ldquo;Memória&rdquo; because it felt so finishing, and I was crying a lot.</p></blockquote><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion<a href=#conclusion class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>#</a></h2><p>The whole album is a &ldquo;listen once in your life&rdquo; type of production. For me, it&rsquo;s a 10/10 and will for sure be overanalyzed over the years. With that said, it&rsquo;s obvious that I probably missed a lot of the special details in it; my main goal was to bring a personal and narrow view of my favorite tracks, so feel free to reach out to me so we can talk more about it. :D</p><p>As always, may the force be with you. 🍒</p></div></div><div class=pagination><div class=pagination__title><span class=pagination__title-h>Read other posts</span><hr></div><div class=pagination__buttons><a href=//localhost:1313/posts/quick-tip-for-the-week-2-improving-native-fuzzy-finder-in-neovim/ class="button inline next">[<span class=button__text>Quick Tip for the Week #2: Improving native fuzzy finder in neovim</span>] ></a></div></div></article></div><footer class=footer><div class=footer__inner><div class=copyright><span>© 2025 Powered by <a href=https://gohugo.io>Hugo</a></span>
