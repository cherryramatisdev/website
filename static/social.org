Finally! A new post from inside neovim using the [[https://github.com/cherryramatisdev/org-social.nvim][org-social.nvim]] plugin :D

Still have a whole lot of features to develop including improving the timeline to be as friendly as possible, but getting there step by step!

Thanks a lot! This project is so exciting and it's been really cool trying to write a client for it.

Can't agree more, it's cool that we'll eventually develop patterns and better documentation for newcoming clients. A open protocol with the freedom of multiple clients is always the way to go

Did some small updates today on [[https://github.com/cherryramatisdev/org-social.nvim][org-social.nvim]], specially improving the timeline by adding the replies inside the target post.

Also I'm rewatching Mr.Robot :D

It's been quite a long time that I watched mr. robot and it's cool to observe I'm still getting surprised by the series direction, quite amazing choices.
